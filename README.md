# API servers

So, they having bad time right now.

My VPS with all set up was hosted on Servervy. And they are down for a while.

Code was only on their server, i haven't ANY copy of code. Like, at all.

What that means? Probably, I will make all things from scratch. They don't respond me + they're down for a BIG while.

I hate when this is happening. I lost all data when my server was at Oracle, and now it's happened again. THANKS.

But hey, maybe it's sign to start making server not on Python, but on TypeScript? Who knows...

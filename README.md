Canary version of API. This branch intended for developers of project that was invited to "organization". Basically, we are running VS Code on own server with own database and running API+WS with live reload, we make changes and testing in real time what we are doing. This is not stable at all, expect downtimes, bugs, not compilable code and etc. Code here pushing automatically every day (or manually if we wanna push smth).
